# webjars-example

This application consists out of two modules:

- a front-end module containing the (static) web assets and
- a back-end module providing a simple HTTP service responsible for serving the static assets _and_ responding to a
  simple REST request.

This repository contains _my_ state of research. The contained modules may serve as templates for future projects.
